# Introduction

This is a Terraform skeleton repository for Terraform workshops.

# Instructions

* Install latest Terraform 0.14.x
* Clone this repository
* Change the "key" in main.tf (see inline comments)
* If you have issues when creating the VPC, change the "region" of the AWS provider (see inline comments)

# Goal of the workshop

The goal is to create a web server in AWS inside a VPC (Virtual Private cloud).
This involves creating several resources and is actually non-trivial in a few
hours without previous experience in AWS and/or Terraform. Therefore this will
soon include some pointers to documentation and the resources you should
create to pull it off.
